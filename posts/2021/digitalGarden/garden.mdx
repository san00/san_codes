That’s it! And this is how I like to think of what I'm doing now. It's growing my garden of thoughts & documenting what I’m learning in all its polished and unpolished glory.

It really is a way to help the future me remember some of the things I’ve learnt and experienced. To see how far I've come. Learning out loud and in public. That and I can eventually start googling my own stuff when I get stuck.

I don’t want to worry about what I write I just want to write it down.
Tend the garden, whether plants, ideas, thoughts etc & they will grow. Slowly but surely, they may also blossom. And I like the idea of blossoming. It makes me smile.

If something I write also helps you or someone else. That's cool. Reach out & let me know. It's good to talk. This is why I like the idea of a digital garden.
